# Planet Conqueror

This project was created as part of my Python learning process. It is based on the **12-hour complete Python tutorial by Bro Code** on YouTube, used to study and understand **data structures, logic, and object-oriented programming (OOP)** with Python.

Although the base code is similar to the tutorial, I made several modifications to make it my own:  
- Added **detailed comments** throughout the code as study notes.  
- Renamed variables and reorganized parts of the code to give it a **personal style**.  
- Implemented a **Restart button**, practicing another feature demonstrated in the tutorial.

**Key learning points:**  
- Working with lists and tuples to store game objects’ coordinates.  
- Object-oriented programming with Python classes.  
- Tkinter for GUI, including canvas drawing, event handling, and buttons.  
- Game logic, including movement, collision detection, and score tracking.

**How to play:**  
1. Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship.  
2. Conquer planets by moving the spaceship to their location.  
3. Avoid crashing into the walls or the spaceship's own body.  
4. When the game ends, click the **Restart** button to play again.
